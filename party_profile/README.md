# party_profile

A party's editable profile card — the free-form identity fields a profile page
renders: a short bio, an optional long bio, an optional country, and language
tags. The whole card is stored as one `Profile` dynamic field on the party's
UID and written in a single call (`set_profile`) — there are no per-field
setters. Only cohesive identity fields live here: typed or collection-shaped
concerns (roles, tags, genres, media, links) each have their own extension,
the party's `name` stays on the core `Party` (`party::set_name`), and the join
date comes from the party's creation event (the indexer has it for free).
`country` and `languages` use validated code primitives (`country_code`,
`language_code`), so a stored value is always a real code. Each changed set
emits compact country/language context, and an existing clear emits the
removed country/language codes; equal replacements still write silently, and an absent clear
is silent.

## What it stores

- Key: `ProfileKey()` (unit struct — one profile per party).
- Value: `Profile { bio_short: String, bio_long: Option<String>,
  country: Option<CountryCode>, languages: vector<LanguageCode> }`.
- Limits: `bio_short` 1–300 bytes (the only required field); `bio_long`
  1–8192 bytes when present; up to 10 language tags, no duplicates.
- `set_profile` replaces in place — the card is overwritten, never stacked.
  `clear_profile` removes the dynamic field entirely (storage reclaimed) and
  is a no-op when no profile is set.

## API

All writes require `&PartyAdminCap` for the exact party; a wrong cap aborts
with `EUnauthorized` at `partyos::party`.

### Writes (cap-gated)

| Function | Description | Aborts |
|---|---|---|
| `set_profile(party, cap, bio_short, bio_long, country, languages)` | Create or replace the whole profile card in one call; changed values emit compact context | validation errors below; wrong cap at `partyos::party` |
| `clear_profile(party, cap)` | Remove the profile and emit its prior country/language codes; no-op when none is set (no event then) | wrong cap at `partyos::party` |

### Views

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `has_profile(party)` | `bool` — whether the party has a profile |
| `profile(party)` | `&Profile` — borrows the card; aborts `ENoProfile` (5) when none is set |
| `bio_short(&Profile)` | `String` |
| `bio_long(&Profile)` | `Option<String>` |
| `country(&Profile)` | `Option<CountryCode>` |
| `languages(&Profile)` | `vector<LanguageCode>` |

## Events

| Event | When | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `PartyProfileSetEvent` | Profile created or replaced via `set_profile` when the complete value changes | `party_id`, `admin_cap_id`, `had_profile`, `previous_country`, `previous_languages`, `country`, `languages` |
| `PartyProfileClearedEvent` | Existing profile removed via `clear_profile` — not emitted when the call is a no-op | `party_id`, `admin_cap_id`, `previous_country`, `previous_languages` |

## Errors

| Code | Constant | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `EEmptyBioShort` | `bio_short` is empty |
| 1 | `EBioShortTooLong` | `bio_short` exceeds 300 bytes |
| 2 | `EEmptyBioLong` | `bio_long` is `some("")` — empty when provided |
| 3 | `EBioLongTooLong` | `bio_long` exceeds 8192 bytes |
| 4 | `ETooManyLanguages` | More than 10 language tags |
| 5 | `ENoProfile` | `profile()` with no profile set |
| 6 | `EDuplicateLanguage` | A language tag appears more than once |

Both writes also surface `EUnauthorized` (0) at `partyos::party` on a
wrong cap.

## Dependencies

- [`partyos`](https://github.com/misofm/partyos) at
  `a55f9a2ae9d782d453305961862789dce9deef5b` — the `Party` authorization
  core.
- [`country_code`](https://github.com/unconfirmedlabs/country_code) at
  `b4c92cb7f772879335344d7b6499b5fa4eafef56` — validated `CountryCode`.
- [`language_code`](https://github.com/unconfirmedlabs/language_code) at
  `61542357f3d2ff989d120185046def7cf6c8bdcb` — validated `LanguageCode`;
  every value is a real ISO 639-1 code by construction, so only count and
  duplicates are checked here.

All are exact Git pins; this manifest has no local-path dependencies.

## Integrator notes

- **Whole-card replace.** Editing one field means re-sending the entire card:
  read the current profile, modify client-side, call `set_profile`. There is
  no partial update.
- **Lengths are bytes, not characters.** `bio_short` (300) and `bio_long`
  (8192) bound the UTF-8 byte length, so multibyte text reaches the limit
  sooner. Validate before sending to avoid aborts.
- **Free text is untrusted input.** `bio_short` / `bio_long` are
  user-controlled strings — sanitize before rendering.
- **The display name is not here.** Read it from the core `Party` object; the
  join date comes from the party's creation event. Do not expect either in
  `Profile`.
- **Events omit bios.** Read the profile when text is needed. Events retain
  ordered validated country/language codes, party and cap IDs, and initial
  attachment status. Set payloads are at most 135 BCS bytes; clear payloads
  are at most 99 bytes. `had_profile` distinguishes first attachment; equal
  replacement and absent clear remain silent after authorization.
